            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>1921</strong> - Born in Serowe, Bechuanaland [now Botswana].</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>1925</strong> - At the age of 4, Seretse became <i>kgosi</i> (king), with his uncle Tshekedi Khama 
                        as his regent and guardian.

                </li>
                <li>

                        Kloof Educational Institute in South Africa, Khama attended Fort Hare University College there.

                <li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>1947</strong> - Khama met Ruth Williams, an English clerk at Lloyd's of London. After a year of 
                        courtship, they married. The interracial marriage sparked an uproar, alarming both the Union of South 
                        Africa, which had established legal apartheid (racial segregation), and the tribal elders of the Bamangwato, 
                        who were angered he had not chosen one of their women.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                        <strong>1949</strong> - After a series of <i>kgotlas</i> (public meetings), he was reaffirmed by the elders in 
                        his role as the <i>kgosi</i> (king), due to his marriage to Ruth.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                        <strong>1951</strong> - Khama and his wife weere exiled from Bechuanaland by the British government.

                        after he had renounced the tribal throne. He became involved in local politics, being elected to the tribal 
                        council as its secretary, one year later.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                        <strong>1961</strong> - Khama founded the Bechuanaland Democratic Party(BDP). His exile gave him an increased 
                        credibility with an independence-minded electorate, and the BDP swept aside its Socialist and Pan-Africanist 
                        rivals to dominate the elections 5 years later, and he became the Prime Minister.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                        A 1965 constitution delineated a new Botswana government, and on 30 September 1966, Botswana gained its 
                        independence. Ten days prior to this, Elizabeth II had promoted Khama within the Order of the British Empire, 
                        appointing him a Knight Commander (KBE).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>1966</strong> - At the time of its independence, Botswana was the world's third-poorest country, poorer 
                        than most other African countries. Khama set out on a vigorous economic programme intended to transform the 
                        nation into an export-based economy, built around beef, copper and diamonds.
                    </p>

                <li>
